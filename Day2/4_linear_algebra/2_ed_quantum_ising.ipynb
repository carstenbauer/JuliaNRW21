If there is no magnetic field, $h=0$, our quantum model reduces to the well-known classical [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) (diagonal = trivial matrix structure -> classical). In this case, we have a **finite temperature phase transition** from a paramagnetic ($T>T_c$) phase, where the spins are **disordered by thermal fluctuations**, to a ferromagnetic phase ($T<T_c$), where they all point into the $z$ direction and, consequently, a ferromagnetic ground state at $T=0$.\n",

    "* Since this would be boring, we want to add quantum complications to this picture by making $H$ non-diagonal. To this end, we expose the quantum spins to a transverse magnetic field $h$ in $x$ direction in the second term. Now, since $\\sigma^z$ and $\\sigma^x$ do not commute (check `σˣ*σᶻ - σᶻ*σˣ` yourself), there is no common eigenbasis of the first and the second term and our Hamiltonian has a non-trivial matrix structure (It's quantum!). If there was *only the second term* the system would, again, be trivial, as it would be diagonal in the eigenbasis of $\\sigma^x$: the quantum spins want to be in an eigenstate of $\\sigma^x$, i.e. align to the magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can see that if we have both terms we have a competition between the spins wanting to point in the $z$ direction (first term) and at the same time being disturbed by the transverse magnetic field. We say that the magnetic field term adds **quantum fluctuations** to the system.\n",

    "It is crucial to realize, that in our calculation we are inspecting the ground state of the system. Since $T=0$, it is purely quantum fluctuations that drive the transition: a **quantum phase transition**! This is to be compared to increasing temperature in the classical Ising model, where it's thermal fluctuations that cause a classical phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. For this reason, the state that we observe at high magnetic field strengths is called a **quantum paramagnet**."
